	/// Attempts to draw a graph to the plane such that a certain equilibrium is attained.
	/// Models the graph as electrically charged nodes connected with springs.
	/// Nodes are attracted by the springs and repelled by electric forces.
	///
	/// By default, the springs behave logarithmically, and (as in reality) the electric repulsion force is inversely
	/// proportional to the square of the distance.
	/// The formulae for the attraction/repulsion forces can be configured through #SpringForce and #ElectricForce.
	///
	/// The algorithm starts from a given configuration (e.g. a random placement)
	/// and lets the forces move the graph to an equilibrium.
	/// Simulated annealing is used to ensure good convergence.
	/// Each convergence step requires O(n<sup>2</sup>) time, where \e n is the number of the nodes.
	///
	/// Force-directed layout algorithms work best for graphs with a few nodes (under about 100).
	/// Not only because of the running time, but also the probability of running into a poor local minimum 
	/// is quite high for a large graph. This decreases the chance that a nice arrangement is attained.

	/// \code
	/// var g = new CompleteGraph(7);
	/// var layout = new ForceDirectedLayout(g);
	/// layout.Run();
	/// foreach (var node in g.Nodes())
	///		Console.WriteLine("Node "+node+" is at "+layout.NodePositions[node]);
